**1.** I looked back at grid graphs and some of my observations about them. I explored the structure of grid graphs, since they have a simple structure, and how that structure manifests itself in the adjacency matrix. I also explored the bipartite structure of graphs and explained how to choose the two sets of vertices such that the graph is bipartite.

**2.** Dr. Argentati and I reviewed my progress over the past week and examined some of the topics I had studied and conjectures I had made. In many cases where I had found a result, Dr. Argentati discussed theorems in linear algebra that led to the result. In particular, this helped explain the results I produced for disconnected graphs and the sum of the squares of the adjacency matrix. In other instances where I had failed to produce a result, Dr. Argentati reviewed some of the difficulties in producing results and proofs. In many cases, the topics that I studied were not covered in some of the texts that Dr. Argentati had used for reference, so some questions were left unanswered. We also discussed some of the potential weaknesses of a linear algebraic approach to graph theory. For instance, I had produced no positive results pertaining to embeddings of graph in the plane, and embeddings were not covered in texts. We also discussed how best to round out the project and organize my results.

**3.** I returned to the conjectures I had made on the previous two days regarding the standard deviation of the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix. When we met, Dr. Argentati presented a theorem from linear algebra, that for A a symmetric matrix, the sum of the squares of the eigenvalues of A is equal to the sum of the eigenvalues of A^2. From that, and incorporating what I had explored regarding r-walks, I was able to produce a proof of why the sum of the squares of the eigenvalues of A equaled 2e. From there, it was easy to show that this meant that the standard deviation of the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix equals âˆš(2e/(v-1)).

**4.** To conclude the research phase, I examined cycle graphs Cn, which consists of n vertices and n edges connected in an n-cycle. I noticed that they are 2-regular, and if n is even, are also bipartite. I examined the structure of their adjacency matrix, since it has a relatively simple configuration. However, I was unable to determine any relationship or pattern among the eigenvalues except for those necessarily present because they are regular, and some of them are bipartite. This provides a nice conclusion to the research phase by reminding me that mathematical research can be extremely fickle, and exhibit irregularity in even the simplest of cases.
