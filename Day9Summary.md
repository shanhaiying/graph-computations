  * Reviewing and consolidating notes into a finished document.


# Details #

**1.** The entirety of my day was spent typing up the results that I had reach over the past 8 days. I am using a typesetting program called LaTeX. I am stating the results that I made and, if it is reasonable to do so, stating how those conclusions could be reached or proved. I also generated some pictures of graphs in order to accompany the paper. This process will be finished tomorrow.
